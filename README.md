> [!NOTE]
> These extensions are installed automatically using the **Workspace lifecycle hooks** `OnCreate` in the `dev.nix` file

### Workspace Setup (On Create Hooks)

When a new workspace is created from this template, the following setup steps are automatically executed to prepare your development environment:

*   **Install VS Code Extensions:** Ensures `.vscode/extensions.json` exists and installs recommended extensions.
*   **Setting up Dev Environment:** Installs `poetry` and `commitizen` (with `cz-conventional-gitmoji`) using `pipx`, and ensures `pipx` is in your PATH.
*   **Setup Virtual Environment:** Creates a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and activates it.
*   **Add VS Code to .gitignore:** Adds `.vscode/` to your `.gitignore` file if it's not already present.
*   **Remove Template Artifacts:** Cleans up template-specific files like `.git` and `README.md` to prepare for your project.

## Using this Repository as a Template

This repository is designed to be easily used as a template for new Firebase Studio Python workspaces. Follow these simple steps to get started:

### Quick Start

1.  **In Firebase Studio:** Create a new workspace.
2.  **Select "Import from Git":** Choose this option when prompted for a template.
3.  **Enter Repository URL:** Use `https://github.com/hossam-elshabory/fspt` as the source.

Firebase Studio will then automatically set up your Python development environment, including all recommended VS Code extensions and tools.

### Detailed Steps

1.  **Open Firebase Studio:** Navigate to your [Firebase Studio dashboard](https://studio.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Initiate New Workspace Creation:** Click on the option to create a new workspace or project.
3.  **Choose Git Import:** When presented with template options, select "Import from Git" or a similar option that allows you to specify a Git repository.
4.  **Provide Repository URL:** In the field for the repository URL, paste the following:
    `https://github.com/hossam-elshabory/fspt`
    (Note: This repository is publicly accessible for Firebase Studio to clone it.)
5.  **Confirm and Create:** Follow any remaining prompts to confirm the creation of your new workspace.

Once created, Firebase Studio will clone this template, and the `OnCreate` hooks defined in `dev.nix` will automatically configure your development environment, installing necessary Python packages and VS Code extensions.
